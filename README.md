#ISA3D + Anomaly Detection 

This github contains the code used to generate the instance spaces for the ISA3 + Anomaly Detection paper.

The outBuild function is used to run feature selection, and produce the 2D and 3D instance space projections. The resulting projections are stored as matlab objects within the  trials folder, along with viewing angles for plotting.
